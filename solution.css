The solution involves adjusting the CSS to correctly apply the desired styles, recognizing CSS specificity rules. Here are two approaches:

**Approach 1: Increasing Specificity**

By adding `.myClass` to the `#myElement` selector, we increase its specificity to match or surpass the `.myClass div` selector:

```css
#myElement.myClass {
  color: blue !important;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}
```

**Approach 2: CSS Structure Adjustment**

Alternatively, if we want to avoid using `!important`, we could restructure our CSS or the HTML to remove the specificity conflict: 

```css
.myClass {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass .myClassChild {
  color: red;
}

<div class="myClass">
  <div id="myElement" class="myClassChild">
    This text is now red due to structural specificity
  </div>
</div>
```

Remember that `!important` should be avoided unless absolutely necessary because it can make your CSS hard to maintain and debug.  Choose the solution that best fits your overall CSS structure and maintainability goals.
