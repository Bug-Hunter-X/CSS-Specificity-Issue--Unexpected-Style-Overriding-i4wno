# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS where specificity conflicts can lead to unexpected styling results. The provided code snippets show how a more specific selector can override a less specific selector, even if the less specific selector appears earlier in the stylesheet.

## Bug Description

A specificity conflict arises when multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, but those rules have different levels of specificity.  CSS will apply the rule with the highest specificity. In this case, the `id` selector (`#myElement`) has lower specificity than the class selector combined with the child selector (`div.myClass`).  The more specific selector is therefore applied, even though the `#myElement` style appears earlier.

## Solution

The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and potentially refactoring your CSS rules to avoid conflicts. Consider the following approaches:

* **Increase the Specificity of the Overridden Rule:** If necessary, increase the specificity of the rule intended to take precedence. For example, use `#myElement.myClass` to make sure the selector is applied even if it has lower specificity.
* **Refactor Your CSS:** Improve code clarity by eliminating redundancy or avoiding overlaps between selectors. Using more descriptive class names can improve readability and help to maintain specificity consistency.
* **Use !important (Use Sparingly):** While functional, it has many negative consequences, and is discouraged. Only use this as a last resort and avoid overusing it.
