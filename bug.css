The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where specificity conflicts lead to unexpected styling results.  The `id` selector on the `#myElement` is overridden by the more specific class selector `.myClass` on the `div` element, which contains the `#myElement`.

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

<div class="myClass">
  <div id="myElement">
    This text should be blue, but is red due to specificity.
  </div>
</div>
```
